There are two programs you can work with in this class:
- hello.bbj
- TaskApp.bbj

hello.bbj is a very simple program that can run in GUI, BUI, and the DWC.

TaskApp.bbj is a larger program that includes Task.bbj, TaskProperties.bbj, 
TaskView.bbj, Utils.bbj, Settings.bbj, and DWC101.css.
The program is written in an object-oriented style that will make it less 
overwhelming to work with, so that you can make modifications to files and 
methods without needing to understand every aspect of the program as a whole.

If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed, remember that you can practice many
of the exercises on hello.bbj to get your bearings.
